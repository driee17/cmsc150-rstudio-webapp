  In this exercise, I have learned how to integrate my last exercises using R Shiny. R Shiny is a framework for RStudio to create web applications using R Scripts and programming language. 
  
  First of all, using R Shiny to integrate my past exers was easier than using other programming languages and frameworks (HTML, CSS, JS) since it already uses the native R language, and that I do not need to transition my codes and programs into another programming language. However, it is quite difficult to learn at first since many things are needed to be learned and implemented so that I would be able to create a web app for my exercise. Moreover, my experience in using this framework was great and I've learned many functions like observeEvent() and eventReactive(), and how to design and create elements in the web app through the R syntax.
